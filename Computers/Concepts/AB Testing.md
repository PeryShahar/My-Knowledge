## AB Testing

ðŸ’¡ A/B testing is a method of comparing two versions of a webpage or app against each other to determine which one performs better. The goal of A/B testing is to identify changes that increase or maximize an outcome of interest, such as click-through rate or conversion rate. The test is usually performed by randomly assigning users to either the A or B version of the webpage or app and comparing the results. A/B testing can be used to test changes to anything from website copy to entire user interfaces.
