The term "centralized" refers to a system or architecture where control and decision-making authority are concentrated in a single location or component. In a centralized system, all data, resources, and functionalities are managed and coordinated by a central entity, often referred to as a server or a central node.

To provide a metaphor from real life, imagine a large corporation with multiple branches spread across different cities or countries. In a centralized organizational structure, all major decisions and policies are made by the head office or the corporate headquarters. The branches have limited decision-making power and depend on the central authority for guidance, resources, and direction. All important information flows through the central office, and the branches follow the instructions and guidelines set by the headquarters.

Similarly, in software engineering, a centralized system can be compared to this corporate structure. The central server or node acts as the headquarters, controlling and managing the entire system. All the data, resources, and functionalities are stored and controlled in one central location, and other components, such as client applications or remote devices, rely on the central authority for access and operations. This centralization provides a clear hierarchy and control, but it can also introduce bottlenecks, single points of failure, and limited scalability, as all interactions and dependencies revolve around the central entity.

It's worth mentioning that the concept of centralization is often contrasted with decentralization, where decision-making authority and control are distributed among multiple entities or components. Decentralized systems can offer benefits like increased fault tolerance, scalability, and flexibility, as decision-making can be distributed and resources can be utilized more efficiently.
