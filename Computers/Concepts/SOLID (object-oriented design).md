## SOLID (object-oriented design)

<aside>
ðŸ’¡ SOLID is an acronym that represents a set of principles for object-oriented design. These principles aim to guide developers in writing software that is easy to understand, maintain, and extend. Each letter in SOLID represents a specific principle:

1. Single Responsibility Principle (SRP): This principle states that a class should have only one reason to change. It suggests that a class should have a single responsibility or purpose, and it should encapsulate that responsibility. By adhering to the SRP, classes become more focused, modular, and easier to test and maintain.
2. Open-Closed Principle (OCP): The OCP states that software entities (classes, modules, functions) should be open for extension but closed for modification. This means that when new functionality needs to be added, the existing code should not be modified. Instead, the code should be designed in a way that allows new features to be added through inheritance, composition, or other means, without altering the existing codebase.
3. Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP): The LSP states that objects of a superclass should be replaceable with objects of its subclasses without affecting the correctness of the program. In other words, if a class is derived from a base class, it should be able to substitute the base class in any context without introducing unexpected behavior or violating the expected contract of the base class.
4. Interface Segregation Principle (ISP): The ISP emphasizes that clients should not be forced to depend on interfaces they do not use. It promotes the idea of creating specific interfaces for different client needs, rather than having large, monolithic interfaces. This principle helps to prevent interface pollution and ensures that clients only depend on the functionality they actually need.
5. Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP): The DIP states that high-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions. It also states that abstractions should not depend on details; details should depend on abstractions. This principle encourages the use of dependency injection, inversion of control containers, and programming to interfaces, allowing for flexible and loosely coupled systems.

By following the SOLID principles, developers can create more maintainable, scalable, and testable object-oriented code. These principles promote code reusability, modularity, and flexibility, ultimately leading to better software design and development practices.
