*Reverse engineering*

Reverse engineering is the process of analyzing a product or system to understand how it was designed and how it operates. This can involve taking apart a product, examining its components, and analyzing its behavior. The goal of reverse engineering is often to create a new product or system that is similar to the original, or to identify weaknesses or vulnerabilities in the original design. Reverse engineering can be used in many fields, including software engineering, mechanical engineering, and electronics, among others.
