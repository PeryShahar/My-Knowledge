*Design Pattern*

Design patterns are reusable solutions to common software engineering problems. They are often used to address specific challenges that arise during the development process, such as organizing code for maintainability, improving performance, or ensuring scalability. Design patterns are usually grouped into categories based on their purpose and characteristics, such as creational patterns, structural patterns, and behavioral patterns. By using design patterns, developers can save time and effort by leveraging existing solutions to common problems rather than having to reinvent the wheel each time they encounter a challenge.
